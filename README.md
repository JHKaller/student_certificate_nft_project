In this project I would like to distribute student certificates as NFTs.

Each certificate is stored as an image, with the associated metadata.

Only once the cohort is over, the owner is able to create the certificate collectibles.

After Certificate Creation, the NFT should be directly send to a selected wallet address and be accessible via IFPS using Pinata as a tool.
